Hello, I’m Pia.

I love learning. Also solving hard problems, exploring new paradigms, understanding architecture and architect systems, and open-source are the things that enjoy. My goal is to design a product based on a new system that can bring a more positive paradigm to the world with technology.

I’m a strong advocate of blockchain technology. Focusing on understanding complex architecture and building the system with programming in a way to impact the world positively, with products to the crypto industry.

Currently working at [herodotus.dev](http://herodotus.dev/) as Product Engineer on the backend indexer using Rust language. Also studying computer science at [Korea University](https://cs.korea.edu/en_cs/index.do).

My learning mostly comes from building in public. It helps me to learn from scratch and also helps other people who might face similar challenges in understanding complex concepts.

- [mini-storage-proofs](https://github.com/rkdud007/mini-storage-proofs) : To understand Storage Proofs. I believe storage proof is one of the important technologies that can scale the current blockchain infrastructure without harming its philosophy.
- [rifle](https://github.com/rkdud007/rifle) : To learn and practice rust. Tried to find some simple and fun projects to practice Rust programming language as the first step.
- [chess-dojo](https://github.com/rkdud007/chess-dojo) : To learn the Dojo game engine compile Cairo language. Cairo is a provable language that is independent of the blockchain environment. I see potential from provable execution that is utilized in gaming.

These are the repositories for work purpose.

- [OP stack indexer](https://github.com/HerodotusDev/opstack_indexer)
    - to implement OP stack-based chains and Optimism need an indexer to handle events that settled on L1. Also write [OP Stack Grant Report](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Cr-nqwMQEa2jswIo6MdsO3bdZl-gnwFNAEwuy2zF6jk/edit#heading=h.miibbtckvn9x) based on the work. 
- [Rust accumulators](https://github.com/HerodotusDev/rust-accumulators)
    - Herodotus have off-chain verification logic, which generates proof/verification on MMR data structure means highly CPU-bounded tasks. To increase off-chain process performance compared to the previous accumulator implemented in Typescript.
